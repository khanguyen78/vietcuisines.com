### Ingredients (2 loaves)

-   500g flour (or 4 1/4 cups)
-   100g butter (or 1/2 cup)
-   15g fresh yeast (or 0.5oz)
-   3 tablespoons sugar
-   2 small eggs
-   2,5dl milk (plus a little more to dissolve the yeast) (or 1 cup and 1 tablespoon)

-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1 teaspoon cinnamon
-   1 teaspoon fennel seeds chopped or powdered
-   2 boiled eggs (optional)

### Instructions (Time: 4 hours)

Start by dissolving the yeast in a bit of warm milk. Add 100g (1 cup) of flour (out of the total weight) and 1 tablespoon of sugar (also out of the total amount of sugar). Leave the dough to rise covered for 20 minutes in a warm place.

Let it rise covered for 2-5hours depending on the place you leave it (my kitchen was warm and it took about 3h30). Once is has doubled in size, divide the dough in two parts. Leave a bit of dough from each part to later make the cross. Form round loaves and place them in a floured baking tray.

Flatten their surface a little and place the boiled eggs on top (optional). Form four strips with the remaining dough and place them on top of the eggs. Brush the loaves with a egg wash and bake in a preheated oven to 210ºC (410ºF) (fan off) until the loaves are golden (about 20 minutes). Let it cool down before serving.
