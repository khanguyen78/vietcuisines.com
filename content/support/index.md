- __update/maintain this site__  
  Life happens and we all get busy at one point or another and this site might suffer from lack of updates, but we never stop eating and trying new foods. And if you really loved that dish that you ate the other day, please take a moment in your busy day and add something new to the site, or even fix a bug or two. 
- __share the word__  
Share/like/Follow us on Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. And now that Tiktok isn't going away, Tiktok too!!!  
- __Donate__  
Money Money Money:) vietcuisines.com is a serverless, static site hosted in AWS using the Hugo framework with minimal costs, highest uptime, and fastest website response in mind. Nonetheless there are minimal costs associated with running this site (Route53 Domain, hosted zones, web traffic, and storage to name a few). Your contributions - however small or large - help keep this site running.
- __Photos__  
  Are you an experienced photographer? Do you have stock photos that you would like to donate to us for free use? We would love your best and favorite photos of Vietnamese dishes. 
- __Nutritionist__  
Are you a nutritionist?   
I've noticed is that Vietnamese foods, however delicious, lack nutritional information. Or it might be the case that their individual ingredients have the nutritional information. but collectively as a dish this information is lacking. We would love your help in documenting nutritinoal information.
