# About Viet Cuisines 

vietcuisines.com was started by Megan Nguyen in her junior year of high school for her Girl Scouts Gold Award project. The goal of this site is to share the recipes of Vietnam so the younger generations can carry on the traditions. We invite food aficionados of all ages, near and far, to contribute their recipes and share their knowledge and experiences.
